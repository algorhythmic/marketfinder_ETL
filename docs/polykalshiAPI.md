# Could you provide links to or content from these additional documentation sections
--Original Request--
<!-- 1. Kalshi API Complete Specification

Can you provide or direct me to:

- Request Parameters: Query filters, pagination parameters
- Response Schema: Full market object structure
- Authentication: Header requirements, API key usage
- Rate Limits: Requests per minute/hour limits
- Pagination: Cursor vs offset-based, page size limits

3. Rate Limiting Policies: To design appropriate batch processing
4. Market Object Schemas: Complete field definitions for standardization -->

--Answer to Request--
I can provide you with the available documentation content from the search results, though some specific details you're looking for may require accessing the official documentation directly.

## Kalshi API Complete Specification

### Authentication

Kalshi uses API key authentication with tokens that expire every 30 minutes[^1][^2]. The authentication process requires:

- **API Key Generation**: Create an API key in your account settings after creating a Kalshi account[^1][^2]
- **Token Management**: Your code needs to handle periodic re-login to maintain active sessions due to the 30-minute expiration[^1][^2]
- **Environment Variables**: Store credentials securely using environment variables rather than hardcoding them[^1]

**Authentication Headers**: The search results reference cookie-based authentication in the Python client examples[^3]:

```python
# Configure API key authorization: cookie
configuration.api_key['cookie'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```


### API Endpoints Structure

Kalshi's REST API follows standard principles with logical endpoint structure[^2]:

- `/markets` - Market data and listings
- `/events` - Event information (collections of related markets)
- `/orders` - Order management
- `/portfolio` - Account and position data

**Base URLs**[^4]:

- **Demo Environment**: `https://demo-api.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2/`
- **Production Environment**: `https://trading-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/`


### Request Parameters and Filtering

The markets endpoint supports filtering with parameters like[^2]:

```
GET /markets?status=open&event_id=FRSEP23
```


### Pagination

Kalshi uses cursor-based pagination to avoid data drift[^2]:

```
GET /markets?cursor=abc123&limit=50
```


### Rate Limits

Kalshi implements rate limiting to protect services[^1]. The search results mention that "Kalshi caps the number of requests to prevent abuse" but don't specify exact limits. Best practices include[^1]:

- Using exponential backoff when hitting limits
- Queueing requests to spread them over time
- Caching frequently accessed data to reduce API calls


## Polymarket Authentication Documentation

### CLOB API Credentials

Polymarket uses a two-level authentication system[^5]:

**L2 API Key Authentication** requires these headers[^5]:

- `POLY_ADDRESS`: Polygon address
- `POLY_SIGNATURE`: HMAC signature for request
- `POLY_TIMESTAMP`: Current UNIX timestamp
- `POLY_API_KEY`: Polymarket API key
- `POLY_PASSPHRASE`: Polymarket API key passphrase


### API Credential Generation

The credentials are generated deterministically[^5]:

- `key`: UUID identifying the credentials
- `secret`: Secret string used to generate HMACs (not sent with requests)
- `passphrase`: Secret string sent with each request

**Generation Process** (from search results)[^6]:

```python
from py_clob_client.client import ClobClient

host = "https://clob.polymarket.com"
key = "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"  # From Polymarket account export
chain_id = 137  # Polygon Mainnet

client = ClobClient(host, key=key, chain_id=chain_id)
api_creds = client.create_or_derive_api_creds()
```


## Market Data Structure Comparison

### Kalshi Market Object

The search results show Kalshi market objects include[^4]:

- Market ID (UUID format)
- Market history and statistics
- Order book data with bid/ask information
- Settlement information
- Trading positions


### Polymarket Market Object

Polymarket markets include these fields[^7][^8]:

- `id`: Market identifier
- `slug`: Market slug
- `condition_id`: CTF condition ID
- `question_id`: CTF question ID
- `tokens`: Binary token pair
- `question`: Market question
- `category`: Market category
- `active`: Boolean for market status
- `closed`: Boolean for market closure
- `end_date_iso`: Market end date
- `minimum_order_size`: Minimum order size
- `minimum_tick_size`: Minimum tick size

**Sample Polymarket Response Structure**[^7]:

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "slug": "<string>",
  "archived": true,
  "active": true,
  "closed": true,
  "liquidity": 123,
  "volume": 123,
  "start_date": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
  "end_date": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z"
}
```


## Additional Endpoints and Capabilities

- `/cached/markets/{market_id}` - Individual market data (cached)
- Market history endpoints for backtesting[^10]
- WebSocket endpoints for real-time data[^10]


### Polymarket Specific Endpoints

- **Gamma Markets API**: `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets`[^7]
- **CLOB API**: `https://clob.polymarket.com`[^11]
- Market filtering by liquidity, volume, dates, and tags[^7]


### Market Categories and Features

## Documentation Access Recommendations

For complete specifications, you should access:

1. **Kalshi Official Documentation**: The search results reference official API documentation at kalshi.com/api[^10]
2. **Polymarket Developer Docs**: Available at docs.polymarket.com for complete CLOB and Gamma API specifications
3. **GitHub Repositories**:
    - KalshiPythonClient for implementation examples[^9][^3]
    - Community-built tools and examples[^12]

The search results provide a solid foundation, but for production implementation, you'll want to access the official documentation directly for the most current rate limits, complete schema definitions, and any recent API changes.
